# Compile: cc -Wall -c ctest1.c ctest2.c
Compiler options:

    * -Wall: include warnings. See man page for warnings specified.

# Create library "libctest.a": ar -cvq libctest.a ctest1.o ctest2.o
# List files in library: ar -t libctest.a
# Linking with the library:
c - suppress the messages
v - display additional information such as files getting added
q - append the specified file to the archive .ar does not check if the file is already a member in archive
    * cc -o executable-name prog.c libctest.a
    * cc -o executable-name prog.c -L/path/to/library-directory -lctest

Historical note: After creating the library it was once necessary to run the command: ranlib ctest.a. This created a symbol table within the archive. Ranlib is now embedded into the "ar" command.
